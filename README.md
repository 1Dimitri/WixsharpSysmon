# WixSharpSysmon

This project allows to create a msi package which includes the latest sysmon executable and a well-known configuration file for it for the x86 and x64 architecture.

This package, once built, includes
- [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) from Microsoft.
- [Sysmon Rules](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config)  from SwiftOnSecurity.

The package has been built with [WixSharp](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp) from Oleg Shilo.

This repo is the [source code to build the msi files](https://github.com/1Dimitri/WixSharpSysmon).

None of the authors mentioned above is responsible for the way the setup or the end program operate, which by the way, include no warranty at all.
